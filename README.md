<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

netSpecs is a Google Chrome extension built on **Manifest V3**. It provides the user with information about both their device and network connection.
Commonly, when attempting to troubleshoot issues or seeking technological support, it is necessary for a user to know specifications relating directly
to their device. However, there is no universal method to determine many of these details as the way to check them varies on several factors including
the type of network connection and the operating system used. netSpecs conglomerates all these into a simple, easy-to-use platform that works **natively**
in the browser, **regardless of the device or OS**.

This extension relies on the **Network Information API** and specifically the navigator interface. The UI was built using HTML and CSS, while the API
calls and event handling is done using JavaScript. Below are some of the values retrieved from the API

> `Name1:` Definition 1
> `Name2:` Definition 2
> `Name3:` Definition 3
